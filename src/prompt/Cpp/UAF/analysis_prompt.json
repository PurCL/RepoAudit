In funtion `foo(int * ptr) {free(ptr)}`, the pointer `ptr` points to the same memory object as the pointer `base` in function `goo() {foo(base);}`.

List all paths in which the key points can be executed. A function may have many nested execution paths due to if-else and switch conditions. This step requires you to identify all branches where the key points can be executed for your later analysis. Do not miss exception/error-handling paths and early returns (e.g., `if (pointer == NULL) { free(src); return -1; }`). When you encounter a return statement or exception in a branch that exits the current function, that path ends here and cannot be a prefix for other paths. In other words, each extracted path should contain at most one return statement or exception.",

For example, if `ptr->x = src;`, then the pointer `ptr->x` is an alias of src, but the pointer `ptr` is not an alias of src. If pointer `ptr` is returned to the caller but the field member `ptr->x` is not, then src is not considered to have propagated to the caller via `ptr`.",

        "Also, freeing `ptr->x` is independent of freeing `ptr`. Remember that freeing a pointer does not free its field members. For example, in function `foo() { free(ptr->x); free(ptr); }`, freeing ptr does not free the field member `x` of ptr. Do not consider this as a UAF bug."
